<h1 align="center"><b><u>VB RAW Viewer</u></b></h1>
<h3 align="center"><u>By <a href="mailto:si@VBgames.co.uk">Simon Price</a></u></h3>
<p align="left"><b>Important Note!</b></p>
<p align="left">Due to a bug in VB, don't run this program from the VB IDE
because (in my experience) half the polygons don't show up! Run the compiled
.exe to see the correct results.</p>
<p align="left"><b>About</b></p>
<p align="left">This program is very simple, you can view .raw files and whilst
the object loaded spins round you can zoom in and out. It does not use DirectX
or OpenGL to do this, yet it still runs (fairly) fast because of usage of
Windows API and (fairly) good coding. It could run faster but this was just a
quick project to help me understand the .raw file format because I am making a
3D modelling program with import/export options. To find out more about that
program, <a href="http://www.vbgames.co.uk/screenshots/si3dmodeller.htm">click
here</a>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Boring Legal Stuff</b></p>
<p align="left">No guarantees, run the program at you own risk. Do not claim
that this source code to be yours. That's about all the rules I can think of.</p>
<p align="left"><b>And the reason I gave this to you for free</b></p>
<p align="left">OK, part of the reason was to advertise my website, <a href="http://www.VBgames.co.uk">www.VBgames.co.uk</a>
, please visit it if you are interested in Visual Basic games/graphics
programming.</p>
